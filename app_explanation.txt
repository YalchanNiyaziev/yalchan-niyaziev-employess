Project Task: The task is to find the pair of employees who have worked together the longest in all projects.
Project Structure: The project is divided into separate layers, as they are divided into packages for easier maintenance and readability.
      - Data layer: Responsible for the data. Here are two packages:
          * model: It stores data transfer models;
          * repository: It is responsible for retrieving and recording data;
      - Business layer: It is responsible for logical operations. There is the service package, which contains the EmployeeToProjectService class.
                        The class EmployeeToProjectService is responsible for filtering all extracted data so that the condition is met fulfilled.
Execution: Execution starts from the entry point, which is the main method, which is located in the Main class. An object of class EmployeeToProjectService is created there.
           To find the required team, the getTheBestTeam () method of EmployeeToProjectService is called. This method gets all teams by calling the getAllTeams () method.
           It checks all the records by making several comparisons. The first comparison is made on the basis of projects.
           If it also passes successfully, the next check is performed, which checks whether the dates of the two records are compatible so that they can be a team.
           If this check is also successful, a team is created which is unique or an existing one is edited, by adding additional days and projects.
           Finally, getTheBestTeam() compares all teams by the number of working days together and returns the required team.
